# Media-Collage-Generator

## Introduction
The Media Collage Generator is an interactive web application designed to create dynamic collages from user-uploaded images and videos. Users can customize their collage by selecting different background colors and watch as their media files are transformed into a creative display.

## Features
- **Media Uploads**: Users can upload multiple images and videos, which will be automatically incorporated into the collage.
- **Dynamic Collage Layout**: Media items are displayed with random transformations, including rotations and scaling, to create a visually engaging collage.
- **Background Color Selection**: Users can customize the background color of the collage area, allowing for further personalization of their collage.
- **Responsive Design**: The collage adjusts its size dynamically based on the content, ensuring that the collage is displayed beautifully across different device sizes.

## How It Works
1. **Upload Media**: Users can select images and videos from their device. The application supports multiple uploads, catering to various file types.
2. **Generate Collage**: By clicking the "Generate Collage" button, the uploaded files are processed. Each media file is added to the collage with random size adjustments, rotations, and positioning to ensure a unique layout every time.
3. **Customize Background**: A color picker allows the user to change the background color of the collage, which dynamically updates to reflect the chosen color.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page and handling media uploads.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsiveness of the collage layout.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the dynamic aspects of the application, such as file processing, element manipulation, and interactive features.
